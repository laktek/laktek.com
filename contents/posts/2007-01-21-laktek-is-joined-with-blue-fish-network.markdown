One of my new year perspectives was to give more attention to my blog and serve it to much bigger audience. Today I was notified by <a href="http://www.bluefishnetwork.co.uk">Blue Fish Network</a> that they have added my blog to their network. I see this as yet another opportunity to expand my blog to a wider audience.

Blue Fish is a UK based global Blog network, which currently includes 67 members. These members muses on wide array of subjects. I've been included in Technology stream along with other cool folks like <a href="http://thoughthacker.com/">Nick Barrett</a>, <a href="http://textonic.slickplaid.net/">Kevin Sylvia</a> and <a href="http://cloud09media.wordpress.com/">Francisco.</a>

So I take this opportunity to thank Andy Merrett and rest of the Blue Fish Network for accepting me to your community. Hoping to build up some great relationships with this opportunity.
