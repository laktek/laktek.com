First of all sorry for letting this space go on a hiatus yet again.. Though I tried to make it a habit of posting regularly, other priorities didn't allow me to do it as I wish. In last few months I had to run through lot of challenges in real life and in hacking, which I feel would be worthy to share. I promise that I will start posting them soon.

Meanwhile, I'm glad to inform you that I will also be contributing to <a title="Ruby Best Practices" href="http://blog.rubybestpractices.com">Ruby Best Practices Blog</a>, which is a collaborative effort organized by <a href="http://majesticseacreature.com/">Gregory Brown</a> of <a href="http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com/">Prawn</a> fame.
