Jonathan Schwartz has <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/java_is_everywhere">announced</a> that SUN microsystems is going to change their stock trading symbol from SUNW to JAVA. This move gives an implicit meaning that the Java technology is going to be traded and people would be fooled to believe they are going to own the shares of JAVA technology not SUN microsystems. One would wonder was this the real motive behind releasing JAVA as an open source technology ? Spread the technology everywhere and use all it's popularity to raise an organization's stock value.
