It was a year of transition in my life. Some of the highlights of 2010 were:
<ol>
<li> Completed my degree and marked the end of formal education.</li>
<li>Saw <a href="http://curdbee.com">CurdBee</a> becoming a more established product (<a href="http://vesess.com/tags/curdbee/">We shipped</a> loads of new features in 2010). </li>
<li>Completed another successful Google Summer of Code (probably my last) with <a href="http://www.web2media.net/laktek/tag/opennebula/">OpenNebula project</a>.</li>
<li>Got to learn lots of new stuff (asynchronous processing, real-time communication, etc) by working on <a href="http://www.web2media.net/laktek/tag/realie/">Realie project</a>, which was my final year project in University.</li>
<li>Increased traffic to my blog by 300% (but I should have blogged more)</li>
<li>Bought my first car.</li>
<li>Finally, Bought an iPhone :).</li>
</ol>

Lots of interesting things have already planned for 2011. It's surely going to be a more challenging year ahead.
