Last week I began the chapter 2 of my life, after going through 13 exciting years of college education, I finally entered into higher education. I got selected as an internal student of <a href="http://www.itfac.mrt.ac.lk/">IT Faculty of University of Moratuwa (UoM)</a>.

I regard this as a great opportunity, since this course is considered more job oriented and updated course (Also saying that you are a undergrad at UoM is a pride itself). Another thing that excites me is the opportunities you get in this University. Last week the team from our faculty won the local competition in <a href="http://dotnetforum.lk/forums/15703/ShowPost.aspx#15703">Microsoft Imagine Cup</a> for the second consecutive year and there are many students from our faculty working on projects for <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Google Summer of Code</a>. See how exciting it is !

University enivronment is quite different. People, culture and traditions are all new and getting used to it is not that easy. At times it's fun and challenging. I love this both fun and challenge.
