This is a great achievement for me than successfully completing GSOC project itself. It's a great pleasure to see people around the globe consuming the my code to get the things done.

The 3 modules will make your life easy when reusing the content available in Flickr, Youtube and Technorati in your site. So you could come up with wonderful mashups in SilverStripe platform. If you are a photographer, media creator or a blogger try using these modules with SilverStripe to create truly customized site for yourself (you'll amaze to see how easy it is).

Love to hear your feedbacks and suggestions.
