Insipired by the post of <a href="http://unprotectedthoughts.com/2006/10/internet-and-me_28.cfm">Sam</a> I also tried to recollect the memories of early internet experiences. The first web site I visited was <a href="http://www.cricket.org">www.cricket.org</a>, still I visit the site daily which is now more popular now as cricinfo.com. Connecting to internet using Lanka Internet Prepaid Card with a 28k modem was funny in the current context, but that little experience let me to a whole new world of opportunities.

Anyway can you remember what was the first site you visited ?
