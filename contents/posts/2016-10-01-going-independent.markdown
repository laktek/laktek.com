I was 16 when I first wanted to start my own business.

I was living in Sri Lanka and just finished O/Ls (high school). Country was politically unstable and everyone knew war will start soon. Many of my friends were leaving the country. Some could afford to apply to foreign universities. Others were considering taking the risky and illegal routes.

Two years before that I heard about the internet (from a program on national TV). I learnt how to build web sites and a local startup offered me to join as an apprentice. It was the era of internet portals and they owned the most popular one in Sri Lanka. Many friends at school didn't believe me. "No business will offer a job for a 14-year old". I didn't even bother telling them about the getting paid part.

I just wanted to finish high school, so I can start my own thing. I believed I can create a better portal. I will be immune to country's instability - I will get paid from the internet.

When I told my mentor about my idea, he said "You are not ready!".

I naively thought he might be seeing me as a competition to his business.

"Portals probably won't even exist in next 2-3 years. You don't know internet. You don't know computers. You don't know business. Heck, you don't know the world."

"You probably read about Steve Jobs or Bill Gates. But accept the reality. You live in a third-world country. You are not from a rich, well-connected family. You are a nobody. At best, you will end up creating another outsourced sweatshops."

My bubble popped.

"Instead focus on polishing your skills. Learn English. Go to univeristy. Make new friends. Fall in love. Solve hard problems. Work with smart people. Go see the world. Explore different cultures. Don't waste the best years of your life."

I was in denial. Do you think I can never start a business? "You will find out".

I decided to fight against my odds. In that same year, Eminem released "Lose Yourself".

I got [selected to university](http://www.laktek.com/2006/06/04/stepping-into-the-higher-studies/). I was the only one from my school. No one in my family has gone to university before (my brother followed me afterwards).

I coded. Still on web, but not portals. Google killed portals.

I contributed to [open source software](http://www.laktek.com/2007/11/29/all-my-gsoc-contributions-released-officially). Collaborated with people from [different parts of the world](http://www.laktek.com/2011/06/08/a-month-in-vienna). Released my [own projects](). Talked about my projects [at conferences](http://www.laktek.com/2012/12/04/jscamp-asia/).

I got opportunities to work cloesly with smart people.

[CurdBee](http://www.laktek.com/2012/12/24/end-of-a-chapter/), a bootstrapped in Sri Lanka, made revenue and became profitable. [Nitrous](http://www.laktek.com/2015/03/13/adios-nitrous-sayonara-singapore/), a dev tools company born out of Singapore successfully raised a Series A in Silicon Valley. Atlassian, based in Sydney had one of the most impressive tech IPOs of 2015.

All of them challenged the status quo, went against conventional wisdom. It felt awesome to play a part in those stories. More importantly, I experienced the hard thing about hard things. Better than reading about it from a book.

I lived in 3 countries. Visited more than 25 cities in 12 countries in total. Made lot of interesting friends. All that while holding a passport that's ranked as one of the worst in the world. I have spent ridiculous amount of time dealing with immigration offices and embassies.

I saved. So that I don't have to ask for money from others. I stayed single. I never went for a mortgage or a car lease. I got the permanent residency in Australia as an insurance.

I turned 30 this year. It's been 14 fucking long years. A journey that felt lonely and tiring. Yet I enjoyed it.

Earlier this year my dad passed away. I felt empty going home. All that moments I missed. Is it still worth? I didn't want to lose to myself.

I realised I will never be ready. Odds will be always against me.

I'm willing to bet against the odds.

I'm more afraid of success than failure. If I fail, I can go back to where I was and everyone will say "cool story, bro".

But what if I succeed? Will I have the control of the fly wheel? Would that mean I'd step into yet another unknown territory? Will my family and friends still see me as one of them?
