It's still early morning here in Sri Lanka; I was just starting the day passively glancing over my Twitter feed. In a stream filled with rants over iPhone 4S' form factor and predications on how Siri is changing the world, seeing <a href="http://twitter.com/BreakingNews/status/121730537000943616">this tweet</a> just shocked me. It feels like the passing of someone closer to my life. Yes, Steve was terminally ill, but who'd have thought it will come to him so soon?

I admire Steve Jobs not because of Apple, but for the constant inspiration he gave throughout in his life. As a kid, seeing what Bill Gates has achieved, I believed you need to be an extraordinaire gifted with talent and luck to become successful and change the world.

However, listening to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA">Steve's Standford graduation speech</a> changed my perspective. I started to believe anyone can change their destiny, if they got the true passion and perseverance.

Steve's life was not bed of roses. As a child he was adopted, he had to drop-out from the University, was kicked out from his own company and lived the best years of his life battling with Pancreatic cancer. Yet he managed to <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/291707">"put a ding in the universe"</a>.

Thank you Steve for all the inspiration! May your soul rest in peace!

P.S. - Please Consider donating to <a href="http://pancan.org/section_donate/">Pancreatic Cancer Action Network</a>, to fight against the disease that took Steve's life.
