I was so bored while studing for the exams and just hit on this new <a href="http://google.com/codesearch">Google Code Search.</a> Oh! do you know what I was able to extract with several keyword combinations ? Whole bunch of FTP access and Database connection credentials of sites which are currently live on the net. Those credentials seems to be valid and I didn't want to mess on those sites, so kept them as it is. It's damn simple and even a 3 year old can be a hacker with this.

Anyway folks, better keep your sites secure from the Google Code Spider. From what I read it seems to index all files, including the files in compressed archives found in the public directory. So don't leave your important code there.
