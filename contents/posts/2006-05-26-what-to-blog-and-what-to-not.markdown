Blogging is a unique art. Bloggers are not poets or Technical Writers and not even News Reporters. Bloggers are bloggers and blog post should feel like a blog post ! Even though Blogs are reffered as a free media with no bounds, I feel itâ€™s always quite trivial to decide what to blog and what to not!

I know some people do blog just about anything and <a href="http://xiaxue.blogspot.com/">some do succeed by doing it too</a>. But to be honest itâ€™s always been a twister for me to decide what should go in the blog, (maybe because I just entered to blogsphere and Stage Fever ??) However I keep worrying whether my content do make sense to others? Whether it will help someone in someway? Or is this subject blogged better than this elsewhere?

For now I donâ€™t have a high expectations on blogging (such as getting into Top 100 of Technorati or Receiving a $10k+ check from AdWords) and I think keeping away from obsessions will make blogging more free and fun. Knowing that Iâ€™m not <a href="http://www.web2media.net/laktek/www.zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> or <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/rayozzie/Blog/">Ray Ozzie</a> and I should not always have to be spot on gives me a bit relief.

I enjoy blogging, it will help to keep me busy in my idle hours and helps me to increase my caffeine intake! I know if I master the art, I could be a guru too, until then there is a big learning curve. Finally, I doubt whether this is worthy to get blogged, anyway Iâ€™m pushing PUBLISH!
