After that bizarre story of <a href="http://consumerist.com/344547/microsoft-customer-service-calls-back-10-years-later">Microsoft's support team calling a client back after 10 years</a>, similar thing happend to me yesterday, from <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a> (my hosting provider). They have sent me a payment overdue notice as of February 1st, 2009. Initially, I was wondering whether these tech companies are doing time travelling ? However later revealed as  in the case of M$, Dreamhost too have made a typo while entering the figures....

Today I've got an apology from Dreamhost billing team, and it almost made my day :P
<blockquote> Hi Lakshan!

Ack. Through a COMPLETE bumbling on our part, we've accidentally attempted
to charge you for the ENTIRE year of 2008 (and probably 2009!) ALREADY
(<strong>it was all due to a fat finger</strong>)!

We're really really realllly embarassed about this, but you have nothing
to worry about. Please ignore any confusing billing messages you may have
received recently; we've already removed all those bum future charges on
your account and fixed everything up.

Thank you very very much for your patience with this.. we PROMISE
this won't happen again. There's no need to reply to this message unless
of course you have any other questions at all!

Sincerely,
<strong>The Foolish DreamHost Billing Team!</strong></blockquote>
Maybe adding humor is the best way to cover your mistakes...
