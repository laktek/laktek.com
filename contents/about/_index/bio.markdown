Hi, my name is Lakshan Perera. I'm grew up in sunny &amp; sandy city of Colombo in Sri Lanka. My dad bought a computer when I was 13. I created my first website when I was 14. Since then I haven't looked back.

I did my bachelors at University of Moratuwa. I graduated in 2010 with a BSc. in Information Technology. While at the University, I participated twice in the [Google Summer of Code](http://laktek.com/tag/gsoc) program. First time with [SilverStripe CMS](http://laktek.com/2007/08/25/sweet-summer-of-code-thank-you-google) and then with [Open Nebula](http://laktek.com/2010/05/01/im-with-opennebula-this-summer/). 

During my freshman year itself, I joined [Vesess](http://vesess.com) as an intern. It's one of Sri Lanka's leading web development firms. At Vesess, I created and led the development of [CurdBee](http://curdbee.com), which is now a popular online invoicing application among small businesses and freelancers.

Recently, I created [Punch](http://laktek.githubc.com/punch), an open source web publishing framework. Also, I contribute to [Aloha Editor](http://alohaeditor.org) project.

Apart from hacking, I love to travel and experience different lifestyles. If you like to get in touch with me, drop an email to **lakshan at laktek.com**.
